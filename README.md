## What it does  ðŸ¤–
We want to write a system that allows our admins to submit credit card numbers for validation.
Requirements
Build a Flutter mobile application that can do the following:
â€¢ Allow the user to submit credit card details. Details should include:
Card Number, Card Type, CVV, Issuing Country
â€¢ Ability to infer Card Type from Credit Card number would be beneficial.
â€¢ Check the specified country to make sure it doesnâ€™t exist in a list of banned countries.
â€¢ Make the list of banned countries configurable.
â€¢ If the card is valid â€“ store it in local storage.
â€¢ Display all the credit cards that have been captured during the session.
â€¢ Donâ€™t capture the same card twice.
â€¢ Please also add the ability to scan a credit card (examples attached), and pre-populate the
card number and infer the cart type.
â€¢ Authorization is not necessary for the purposes of this test.
